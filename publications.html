                        <br>
                        <br> We are now accepting contributions, written in English or Chinese, in the following categories: Academic Articles, Op-eds, Field Trip Reports and Original Photography. Submissions are open to all individuals around the world who have a strong interest in Hong Kong affairs, with preference given to rigorous undergraduate submissions. All submissions will be accepted on an ongoing basis.
                        <br>
                        <br> Please email your submissions to uthkpass@gmail.com.
                        <br>
                        <br><strong>Submission Requirements:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>- Academic Articles: We welcome any original academic research, preferably 1500-3500 words in length (including abstracts, tables, graphs, footnotes and references). Submissions will be considered based on popularity of the subject content.
                        <br>
                        <br>- Op-eds: We welcome submissions of opinion articles on any topic related to latest and updated issues happening in Hong Kong and the Greater China region. Submissions should be insightful, and critical reviews of Hong Kong latest affairs. Op-eds should be no more than 1000 words in length.
                        <br>
                        <br>- Field Trip Reports: There is no specific requirements for all field trip report submissions. Simply share your thoughts about places you have explored, things you have experienced, hidden gems in the city worth visiting, or anything else you want to share out about Hong Kong! All field trip reports should be no more than 1000 words in length.
                        <br>
                        <br>- Original Photography: Pictures always speak louder than words.

The maximum file size for a single submission is 4MB, and we do not consider any files bigger than 4MB.
                        <br>
