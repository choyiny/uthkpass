                    <p>UTHKPASS is a student-run, non-profit student society at the University of Toronto. Founded by a group of undergraduate students who have a sense of enthusiasm towards Hong Kong affairs, UTHKPASS has strived to promote interest in the social, political and economic affairs of Hong Kong. As the first student society that puts an emphasis on Hong Kong affairs among North American universities/colleges, we aim to raise awareness on public issues happening around the city through our research initiatives and encourage social engagement of Hong Kong students studying at the University of Toronto.</p>
                    <p>Through organizing different social events and providing connections with several governmental and non-governmental organizations, we aim to offer all members and Hong Kong students at the University of Toronto a broader spectrum of community outreach. On the research aspect, we are going to publish research projects on a monthly basis. Thematic focus will be closely related to latest Hong Kong issues. We kindly look forward to seeing you in our upcoming events!</p>

The “banana” Hong Konger, as he usually refers himself, is currently pursuing a double Major in History and Contemporary Asian Studies, picking up a Minor in Political Science along the way. Outside of class, he serves in a wide variety of positions within campus. You can find Arnold mostly doing his readings at Kelly Library, hanging out with pals at various pubs, swimming and gyming at Hart House or sometimes just out of nowhere. Ultimately, he looks forward to working with the team!</p>

I believe my passion in HK affairs will help me better serve the purpose of HKPASS. Look forward to meeting you guys!</p>
